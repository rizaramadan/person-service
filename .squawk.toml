# Squawk configuration for SQL migration linting

# Exclude rules that don't apply to initial schema migrations:
# - require-concurrent-index-creation: CONCURRENTLY can't be used inside transactions
#   (golang-migrate runs each file in a transaction). Safe for initial schema on empty tables.
# - prefer-robust-stmts: Initial schema is always run once, idempotency guards aren't needed.
